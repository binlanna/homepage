                                        I'm not the protagonist of a novel or anything. I'm just a college student who

                        As a child, Kaneki had all the same features he has now as an adult with black hair. As a normal
                        university student, Kaneki was a somewhat short and scrawny young man with little to no athletic
                        background and preferred to read books. After the steel beam incident, Kaneki bears a scar from
                        the transplant operation on the right side of his abdomen not far from his navel. In his
                        free time, he wore casual clothes.

                        His casual outfit consists of a turquoise hoodie, light black pants, running shoes with a yellow
                        toe and blue outlines reaching the middle of the black base of the soles.

                        At work, he wore the standard Anteiku waiter uniform, consisting of black trousers and a gray
                        waistcoat over a white dress shirt and a black necktie (brown cravat in the anime). Because he
                        could not yet properly control his single kakugan that manifests in his left eye, he wore a
                        medical eye patch to cover it.
